# CS-Build-a-lab
Script to help build a Hacking lab on Debian based distros like Kali, Parrot, and Ubuntu

Install and test KVM or VirtualBox.  If you decide to use both environments, VirtualBox doesn't like the competition 
and will only work if you build and run the VirtualBox VMs first.   Added 4 VMs this version that downloads from 
Vulnhub, unpacks them, then asks if you want to build a KVM VM or a VirtualBox VM.  The VM should be built and run 
at this time so you can verify the install.

Enjoy!
